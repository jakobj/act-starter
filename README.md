# AMC-refactor
- Refactoring of AMC cells into standard act repo structure.

## Organizing ACT Files:
- Typically, different classes of processes should exist in their own namespaces, defined within their own folders.
- The top-level design should be in `src` and import all the modules/sub-processes it needs from the correct namespace. 

## Generating Tests:
- See `test` for folder structure. 
- Each folder in `test` contains one test case. 
- These folder names can be anything.
- The actfile for testing needs to be named `test.act`.
- The process for testing needs to be named `test`.
- The actsim input script needs to be named `test.actsim`.
- Once a new test is set up this way, run `make truth` and input the folder name.
- If actsim exits with no errors, the output from actsim will be saved as `test.truth`, which is assumed to be the correct output.

## Running Tests:
- Run `make runtest` or simply `make` to run through all test cases.

## Cleaning Test Folders:
- Run `make cleantest` to delete the generated files from running the test cases.

## Accessing ACT Files:
- To access the namespaces defined in `src` from elsewhere, add the path to the `src` folder to your `ACT_PATH`.
- The command is `export ACT_PATH=$(pwd)/src:$ACT_PATH` if you're in the folder where this README is located.
